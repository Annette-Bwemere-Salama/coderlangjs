Implement the function createSamples that takes a string and returns two samples of it, one in the lowercase

and another one in the uppercase.

Samples should be combined, i.e. createSamples('HeLLo') should return the string 'helloHELLO'

You must use functions toLowerCase and toUpperCase from the file helper.js
