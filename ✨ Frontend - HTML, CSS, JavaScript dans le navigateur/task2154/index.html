      Ulysses, Ulysses — Soaring through all the galaxies. In search of Earth, flying in to the night.
      Ulysses, Ulysses — Fighting evil and tyranny, with all his power, and with all of his might.
      Ulysses — no-one else can do the things you do. Ulysses — like a bolt of thunder from the blue.
      Ulysses — always fighting all the evil forces bringing peace and justice to all.
