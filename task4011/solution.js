/**
 * Implement the binarySearch function.

 * It should accept a sorted array and a number.
 *
 * It should return the position of the number in the array or -1 if it's not found.
 *
 * You can't use any third party modules or built in Array functions.
 *
 * P. S. If you've forgotten the details, go back to one of the intro lectures and find the pseudocode implementation.
